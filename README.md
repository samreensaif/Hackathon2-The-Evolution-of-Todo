# In‑Memory Todo Console App — Phase I

Run the console application:

```bash
python main.py
```

Features:

- Add task (title + optional description)
- View all tasks
- Update task (title/description)
- Delete task
- Mark complete/incomplete

Notes:

- Storage is in-memory only (no files or databases). Exiting the app loses all tasks.
- Python 3.13+ recommended.
